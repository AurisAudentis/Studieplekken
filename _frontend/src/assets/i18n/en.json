They can change the student's number when pressing on the 'Edit' button. The student can then download this new barcode on his profile page. By clicking on 'manage penalties' in the 'edit user' pop-up, penalties can be added, deleted or changed. Normally this all happens automatically, the functionality of managing the penalties was added to give some flexibility. When adding a penalty the field 'timestamp', should be the moment the violation was made and the field 'For date' is the date from the reservation which was violated. For instance if I'm canceling my reservation for monday on sunday evening, the 'timestamp' will be sunday and the 'for date' will be monday. \n\nAn admin has more possibility's, he can add a new user and change the roles of an existing user. A user can combine two roles, this way it's possible to be a student and make own reservations while also being an employee. Only the admin can make someone an employee. Click on the + sign to add a second role, and on the - to delete this second role.",
    "managementLocation": "Here the employees can see an overview of the different locations, but can't do anything with the data. \nAdmins can change the properties of existing locations, delete locations or add a new location.

    "managementPenalties": "Here the employees can see all the different reasons a student can receive penalty points. Students can see a overview of these events on their help page, when you don't want them to be able to see certain events then you should uncheck the 'show' option.\nAn admin can change the penalty and add a new one.

    "scanning": "On the scanpage the employee must first select a location. This must be the location he or she is located at at the moment. When you can't see the location that you need, ask the admin to assign you to that location.\n\nAfter you have selected a location and pressed open location, a new button will appear to open the scanpage for students. This is the page where students can scan their barcode. Open this page visible to the students and make sure it has focus when you want the scanning to start. If this is the case the scanner should read the students barcode and try to mark him/her as attended automatically.\n\nDuring the scanning you can view which students are present or absent and manually change the status of a student ( e.g. put an absent student as present or vice versa ). However please note that this will cause the scanpage for students to lose focus so only do this at a moment where students can't scan or at the end of the scanning session.\n\nIf you decide students can no longer scan, you can press the close location button, after this you will see three new buttons:\n-Cancel scanning : this is used in case scanning has gone wrong and will mark all students as attended.\n-Send mails: this will send a mail to all absent students to tell them they were absent.\n-Assign penaltypoints: this will assign penalty points to all absent students for being absent.",

If you cancel several days before the reservation, no points will be assigned. The 'Opening Hours' are from the location on the day of your reservation. You can make location reservations on the 'Dashboard', the reservations open on specific days, these can differ.
