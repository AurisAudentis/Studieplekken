inform user that locker reservation cleanup occurs every ...
------------------------------------------------------------
When a user reserves a locker for a location, the user needs to be informed
that when he/she does not pick up the key within ... days, the reservation 
will be canceled.


TODO
----
Test all DBDaos




Changed made that probably need further changes
-----------------------------------------------
	1. DBLocationDao.addLocation -> only add the location, its descriptions in different languages and the lockers corresponding to the location to the underlying database. Not the start/stop locker reservation dates nor the calendar days. Other DAO methods handle these functionalities.

Changes to make, which need further thaught
-------------------------------------------
	1. The Location object keeps the calendar days and lockers in a collection -> remove these from the class. In the ILocationDao implementations, just keep the getter for the Location object without calendar and lockers. To retrieve the calendar/lockers for a location, use methods getCalendarDaysOfLocation() and getLockersOfLocation().
		Note: within the methods to add/delete lockers, make sure that the column number_of_lockers of the Location entry is updated as well
