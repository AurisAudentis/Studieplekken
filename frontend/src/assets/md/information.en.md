# Study Locations UGent

From Monday, November 30, 2020, UGent will make quiet study places available on various campuses to **UGent students who need them.**

The study places will be available from 30 November 2020 until 18 December 2020, and during the exams from 4 January 2021 until 29 January 2021.

## Reservations

A study place can be reserved on a weekly basis, **on Thursdays from 7 p.m. for the following week**. May **we insist on reserving a study place only if you will definitely be present**. Always bring your student card (or your identity card if you have lost your student card) so that those present can be checked. Students who reserve a study place several times and do not show up will not be able to make reservations anymore.

## Entrance

Each study location has specific opening hours, both starting and closing hours are different. Make sure you check these carefully. We expect students to come in staggered and no queues will be formed at the entrance. In order to prevent the spread of the virus, it is important to ensure a distance of at least 1.5m at each location and in each situation. May we therefore ask **not to be present too early or at the starting hour, but to enter spread out in a period of one hour from the starting hour.**

Only students who have made a reservation can use the study place. No empty spaces are filled at the moment itself, this creates queues and gatherings.
Having someone else make a reservation with your email address is not allowed. Any kind of automation during registration is forbidden.

## Security Measures

Strict security measures apply at every study place. Hands need to be disinfected when entering. Wearing a mouth mask is mandatory as soon as you enter the building. Once you are at your study place, you are allowed to take off your mouth mask. The tables and chairs are placed at a safe distance and may not be moved. Physical distancing must be respected at all times. Be sure to stay at home if you are ill or experiencing symptoms.

The study areas are organized by students, staff and volunteers. Treat them and each other with respect. Every study place is supervised. In case of problems or questions, do not hesitate to speak to this person.

## Frequently Asked Questions<a class="anchor" id="FAQ"></a>

> Will attendance be checked by the UGent personel on the location? If yes, when and how frequently?

Checks will be executed when situations arise where a person with a reservation does not have a seat. At that point the list of reservations will be looked at and students without a reservation will be asked to leave the location. Locations are exclusively accessible for people who have a reservation. Empty seats will not be assigned on the spot to people without a reservation.

> Up until which point can I unsubscribe, and how can I do this?

Unsubscribing can be done up until the end of a certain timeslot. This was chosen while keeping possible illness symptoms in mind and allowing people to unsubscribe in these situations. Unsubscribing can be done by navigating to Profile -> Reservations and using the trash icon to delete the reservations.
