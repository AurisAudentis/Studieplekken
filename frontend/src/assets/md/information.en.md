# Study Rooms UGent

In the second semester, UGent organises study places on various campuses for **UGent students who need them**. The study places are available during the entire semester from February 8, 2021 to June 25, 2021.

## Reservations

A study place can be reserved weekly, **each time on Thursday for the following week**. May we urge you to **reserve a study place only if you will definitely be present**. Also, always bring your student ID card (or your ID card if you lost your student ID card) so that attendees can be checked. If you cannot make it to the study space or if you leave earlier, please delete your reservation so another student can take your place.

## Entering

Each study space has specific opening hours, both the starting hour and the closing hour are different. Be sure to check these out carefully on this website. We expect students to **enter in a distanced manner** and that no queues will form at the entrance. In order to prevent the virus from spreading, it is important to maintain a distance of at least 1.5 m between you and others at every space and in every situation. May we therefore ask you not to arrive too early or at the exact starting time, but to enter **within a period of half an hour from the starting time**. Only students who have made reservations can use the study area. No empty spaces will be filled at the time, as this creates queues and congregations. It is not allowed to let someone else make a reservation with your email address. Any form of automation during registration is prohibited.

## Safety measures

Strict safety measures apply at every study place. Hands must be disinfected upon entering. Wearing a mouth mask is mandatory as soon as you enter the building, when walking around or standing up. Once you are at your study place, you may remove your mask and eat and drink at your table. Tables and chairs are placed at a safe distance and may not be moved. Physical distancing should be respected at all times. Be sure to stay home if you are ill or experiencing symptoms.

The study areas are organized by students, staff and volunteers. Please treat them and each other respectfully. Marked study spots are provided for student supervisors, please do not occupy them. Supervision is available at each study spot. If you have any problems or questions, please do not hesitate to speak to this person.
