# Study Locations UGent

In the second semester, UGent again makes quiet study places available on various campuses for **UGent students who need them**.
The study places are available during the entire semester from February 8, 2021 to June 25, 2021.

## Reservations
A study spot can be reserved weekly, **each time on Thursday for the following week**. May we urge you to **reserve a study place only if you will definitely be present**. Also, always bring your student ID card (or your ID card if you lost your student ID card) so that attendees can be checked. Students who reserve a study spot several times and do not show up will not be able to make a reservation again.

## Entering
Each study location has specific opening hours, both the starting hour and the closing hour are different. Be sure to check these out carefully. We expect students to **enter staggered and that no queues will form** at the entrance. In order to prevent the virus from spreading, it is important to maintain a distance of at least 1.5 m between you at every location and in every situation. May we therefore ask you not to arrive too early or at the starting time, but to enter in a staggered manner **within a period of half an hour from the starting time**.
Only students who have made reservations can use the study area. No empty spaces will be filled at the time, as this creates queues and congregations. It is not allowed to let someone else make a reservation with your email address. Any form of automation during registration is prohibited.

## Safety measures
Strict safety measures apply at every study place. Hands must be disinfected upon entering. Wearing a mouth mask is mandatory as soon as you enter the building. Once you are at your study place, you may remove your mask. Tables and chairs are placed at a safe distance and may not be moved. Physical distancing should be respected at all times. Be sure to stay home if you are ill or experiencing symptoms.
The study areas are organized by students, staff and volunteers. Please treat them and each other respectfully. Marked study spots are provided for student supervisors, please do not occupy them. Supervision is available at each study spot. If you have any problems or questions, please do not hesitate to speak to this person.

## Frequently Asked Questions

> Will there be checks by UGent staff at the location? If yes, at what time and how frequently will this happen?

Checks will be made if situations arise where someone who has made a reservation does not appear to have a seat. At that moment, the list of students who have made reservations will be checked and students without reservations will have to leave the study place. The study spot is only accessible to students who have reserved. No empty spots will be filled at the time without a reservation.

> Until when can one unsubscribe, and how should this be done?

Unsubscribing from a time slot is possible until the end of the time slot at the latest, in order to give people with possible symptoms of illness the opportunity to unsubscribe and leave the place to others. You can unsubscribe by going to Profile -> Reservations in the navigation bar and using the trash can to delete reservations.

> What should I do if I feel sick?

If you feel sick or have symptoms, you should not come to the study site. Unsubscribe from the study site and contact your doctor.

> Can I come if I need to be quarantined?

If you need to or are in quarantine you absolutely may not come to the study site. Unsubscribe from the study site. You will strictly follow your doctor's guidelines.

> How is the organization notified if someone tests positive who was present in a study site?

If you were present at a study site and tested positive for corona, please let contacttracing@ugent.be know. The contact tracers will then perform a risk analysis and take further steps.

> Who can I contact if I have questions about the organization of the study places?

General information about the study places can be found on this page. For specific questions about a study place you can always contact the present UGent staff or the student volunteers who will be there when there are no UGent staff members at this study place.

> Who should I contact if I have questions about lost and found?

If you have questions about lost items, you should contact the UGent staff at the specific study site where you lost the item.

> Can I be punished if my student card is accidentally not scanned?

For the time being, scanning is not yet systematic. Thus, no attendances will be noted. This will be indicated in your profile (in the overview of the reservations made) as "No presences recorded". Only students who have made a reservation can be present at the study place.

> Will there be study spots provided during the weekend

No study spots are provided during the weekend.

> I would like to have another study place but all places are full

Expanding the locations and number of study places is unfortunately not possible. The offer we are making now is the maximum offer possible within the current corona measures.

> Will there also be study places during the exam period in June?

Yes, in June 2021 study places will continue to be offered through this application. The location and opening hours can always be found in this application.
