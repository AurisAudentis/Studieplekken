## Study Rooms - Update 28/04/2021
As of March 22, all study places, including those within the libraries, will only be accessible after reservation through this webpage https://studieplekken.ugent.be/dashboard

May we insist that a study place is only reserved if you will actually attend. If you reserve a place but do not show up, this causes a lot of frustration for students and supervisors. We trust that everyone here will take their responsibility to use the study places optimally. There will also be an attendance check every day, both in the morning slots and in the afternoon slots. Places that are not taken at **10am** and **3pm** will be released to be reserved by other students. It is your own responsibility to make sure your student card gets scanned.

If you still have a class or practical on campus and you wish to combine this with a study spot, then we would recommend reserving one of the spots that are released at these times (if not, your reservation may be deleted).

Reservations can be made on Thursday for the following week, there are different reservation hours depending on the location.

If you made a reservation but afterwards decide not to come, please delete this reservation. This can be done under **Profile > Reservations** by clicking on the trash can next to the reservation. The same applies to when you do come, but decide to leave before the end of the timeslot. If you delete your reservation, you are giving your fellow students who do want to come or want to come for the remainder of the timeslot the chance to do so. This way the study rooms can be used optimally.
