## Study Rooms - Update 13/04/2021
As of March 22, all study places, including those within the libraries, will only be accessible after reservation through this webpage https://studieplekken.ugent.be/dashboard

May we insist that a study place is only reserved if you will actually attend. If you reserve a place but do not show up, this causes a lot of frustration for students and supervisors. We trust that everyone here will take their responsibility to use the study places optimally. 

Reservations can be made on Thursday for the following week, there are different reservation hours depending on the location.

If you made a reservation but afterwards decide not to come, please delete this reservation. This can be done under **Profile > Reservations** by clicking on the trash can next to the reservation. The same applies to when you do come, but decide to leave before the end of the timeslot. If you delete your reservation, you are giving your fellow students who do want to come or want to come for the remainder of the timeslot the chance to do so. This way the study rooms can be used optimally.
