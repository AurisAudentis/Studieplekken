## Study spots
As of March 22, all study places, including those within the libraries, will only be accessible after reservation through this webpage https://studieplekken.ugent.be/dashboard

May we insist that a study place is only reserved if you will actually attend. If you reserve a place but do not show up, this causes a lot of frustration for students and supervisors. We trust that everyone here will take their responsibility to use the study places optimally. 

Reservations can be made on Thursday for the following week, there are different reservation hours depending on the location.
